            <p>Pizza cake is a Canadian multiple-layer pizza baked in a pot or cake pan. First invented by Boston Pizza,
                recipes were posted online as early as April 2014, though they did not become viral until the Pillsbury
                Company posted an example in September 2014. Reviews have been mixed, with praise aimed at its taste and
                criticism leveled at its complexity and unhealthiness.</p>
            <p>In April 2014, the Canadian-based chain Boston Pizza included the pizza cake as part of its Pizza Game
                Changers promotion, which featured numerous "outlandish" pizza-related products. The recipe quickly
                became the promotion's most popular, receiving 15,000 votes by 21 April – more than five times as much
                as its nearest competitor, the pizza mint. It held this position until the promotion closed.[1][2] The
                company advertised the concoction as "great for birthdays, bar mitzvahs, weddings, and even lonely
                nights watching infomercials".[1]
                Inspired by the Boston Pizza promotion, later in April a recipe for pizza cake was posted to the So Good
                Blog;[3] one Reddit user who tried the recipe described it as "heavenly", though with a strong "food
                hangover".[2] In September 2014, a recipe for pizza cake by Shawn Syphus was posted by the Pillsbury
                Company. It soon circulated widely on the internet, becoming viral;[4] the company was sometimes
                mistakenly attributed with originating the recipe.[5</p>
            <p>Peter Sagal of NPR found the recipe was more complicated than it appeared, writing "It's not exactly (how
                much you like pizza) × (number of layers)", and that the pizza cake lost the crispiness of the crust. He
                concluded that the recipe was fun to make, and the "obscene amount of cheese" being eaten makes one
                forget issues with the crust.[7] Rosanne Salvatore, writing for the online magazine Bustle, considered
                the cake worth recommending despite the amount of work and expense required; she concluded "I created a
                miracle [the pizza cake] with my bare hands".[8]
                April Blake, writing in the Cleveland Free Times, had a more negative view of the recipe. She considered
                it difficult to prepare, lacking crispiness in the crust, and more unhealthy than a regular pizza.[5]
